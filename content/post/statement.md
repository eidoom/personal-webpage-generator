When applying to the [SAGEX School in Mathematica and Maple](https://indico.desy.de/event/28075/), I had to provide a CV, which was good motivation to update my [CV](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/cv-during-phd/cv.pdf) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/cv-during-phd)) and [current research statement](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/statement-during-phd-md/statement.pdf) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/statement-during-phd-md)).
