My final-year undergraduate research project, supervised by Jonathan Keeling and Kyle Ballantine, involved modelling non-equilibrium quantum systems to explore the continuous symmetries they can exhibit.
Before starting original work, I conducted a literature review, summarised in my [report](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-pre-project-review/raw/0c88438e32059bf8de35d4fa54bc09f955ae0571/report.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-pre-project-review)).
I then developed [a Python simulation](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model) of the two-mode Dicke model to study its quantum phases.
I wrote up the project in my [dissertation](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-report/raw/7c3632e95e86556d568a92af1ef42c09ba14f08f/report.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-report)).
I also presented a [poster](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-poster/raw/736c2497dcd3ad4c408790b48d65f8b4b9e9989e/poster.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-poster)) and defended the work in my viva with a [presentation](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-presentation/raw/e4aaaa264f7ce39ade845f11dcf77f686e9c723f/presentation_handout.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-presentation)).

During the following summer and on into my MASt at Cambridge, I continued work on the project.
We [extended the model](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-imaginary-g), leading to a [publication](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.033802) ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03915)).
The rich behaviour of the system is evident in my [notes](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-extension-notes/raw/3380569852f5db88d9c4c06013dfeb3155a2ed16/notes.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/two-mode-cavity-dicke-model-extension-notes)).
I also gave [summary presentations of the work](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/mphys-8-min-presentation/-/raw/master/presentation_handout.pdf) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/mphys-8-min-presentation)) during my [PhD interviews]({{< ref "phd-applications" >}}).
