I completed the additions to my [thesis]({{< ref "thesis" >}}) after the viva and have made it available on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07115) ([InspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2165266)).
It can also be accessed at [Durham e-Theses](http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/14653/), although they break the PDF hyperlinks.
