I gave a virtual [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/855454/contributions/4606382/) at [ACAT2021](https://indico.cern.ch/event/855454/) (while I had COVID, actually) about our recent [paper]({{< ref "nn-pub" >}}).
Here are the [slides](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/acat2021/) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/acat2021)) and a recording (below).
Apologies for where the audio cuts out in the middle, but it's really Zoom's fault for not supporting Linux well.
