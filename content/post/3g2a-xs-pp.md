In our preprint appearing on arXiv today, [Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion at the LHC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12003), we use the two-loop amplitudes from [Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders]({{< ref "3g2a-2l" >}}) along with the real corrections to obtain differential cross sections of gluon-initiated diphoton-plus-jet production at NLO.
