I attended [British Universities Summer School in Theoretical Elementary Particle Physics 2019](https://sites.google.com/view/busstepp2019/home).
We all gave a short presentation of our research.
Here are my [slides](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/busstepp-slides/body.pdf) ([alt](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/busstepp-slides/-/raw/master/body.pdf)) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/busstepp-slides)).
