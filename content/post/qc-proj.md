Over the summer of 2015, I worked on my first research project with Dr Brendon Lovett.
We investigated the quadrupole interaction between donor electrons in a silicon substrate by computational simulation with a view to guiding experiments in quantum computation.
I produced a [Python code](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/quadrupole-interaction) to do this.
I presented a [poster](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/quadrupole-interaction-poster/raw/309f76e958ad30a90b9f085b2db911b701a9613c/poster_portrait.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/quadrupole-interaction-poster)) and wrote a [report](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/quadrupole-interaction-report/raw/d0dff4b4ce71eb4434dc9f405e6fad27c3c3fee9/report.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/quadrupole-interaction-report)) on the project.
