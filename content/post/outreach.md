At the IPPP, I'm involved with the outreach programme.
Aside from helping to run events, I also did a bit of maintenance on the Galton board exhibit, which I wrote about on [our Computing Club website](https://notes.dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/computing-club/tags/galton-board/).
In recent quarantined times, I experimented with a [virtual version](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/galton-board-web/) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/galton-board-web)), which I discussed [here](https://computing-blog.netlify.app/post/galton/).
