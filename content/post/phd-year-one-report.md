The time has come for my first year progress assessment. Here's my [report](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/phd-first-year-report/progress-report-first-year-phd.pdf) ([source](https://www.gitlab.com/eidoom/phd-first-year-report)).

This draws together my studies of:

* [Modern techniques in calculating scattering amplitudes](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/calculating-scattering-amplitudes-efficiently-exercises) ([notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LV5rVBOR-P7_SjXAVk7uxalxtikTpfjf?usp=sharing))
* [Spinor helicity formalism](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/spinor-helicity-identities/-/blob/master/helicity-nitty-gritty.pdf) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/spinor-helicity-identities))
* [Colour algebra for squared amplitudes](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/colour-matrices-exercises) ([notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11wdrTfha_2wddfHhMMgRBwAOPWaESgaC?usp=sharing))
* [QCD corrections to the cross section of electron-positron annihilation to hadrons](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/electron-positron-to-hadrons/-/blob/master/write-up/annihilation.pdf) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/electron-positron-to-hadrons)) ([notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1azrxkI7hTCsgpSMFjBgrYAkL1YtHH1Lt/view?usp=sharing))
