I gave a [talk](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1073/) in the IPPP internal seminar series about my recent work on diphoton-plus-jet production via gluon fusion, including:
* [Next-to-leading order QCD corrections to diphoton-plus-jet production through gluon fusion at the LHC]({{< ref "ggyyg-xs-pub" >}})
* [Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders]({{< ref "ggyyg-amp" >}})
* [Optimising simulations for diphoton production at hadron colliders using amplitude neural networks]({{< ref "nn-pub" >}})
