My second summer research project was with Jonathan Keeling and Peter Kirton, modelling the polarisation behaviour of a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons.
I wrote a [Python code](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/photon-condensation) to simulate the system for this study.
I [reported](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/photon-bec-polarisation-report/raw/32437a730c86f7d8f15ded162624049f52c8b2a4/report.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/photon-bec-polarisation-report)) on the work at the end of the summer.

In the next academic term, I gave a [presentation](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/photon-bec-polarisation-presentation/raw/74515c5059253a22a0948a1e10f35754c135b711/presentation.pdf) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/ryanmoodie/photon-bec-polarisation-presentation)) to undergraduates in my department.
I also continued work on the project, leading to a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.043844) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01738)).
