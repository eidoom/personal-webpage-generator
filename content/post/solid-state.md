As part of the module PH3012 Thermal and Statistical Physics, we did a study of the one-dimensional [tight-binding model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_binding) of solid state physics.
I wrote [this report](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/solid-state-proj/report.pdf), with [source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/solid-state-proj).
