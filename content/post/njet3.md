Today I released a new version of [NJet](https://bitbucket.org/njet/njet).
It includes all the feature contributions I have made to the NJet library over the last two years, including a couple of two-loop analytic amplitudes as well as some one-loop diphoton processes and a library of infrared limit functions.
