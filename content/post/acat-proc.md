The preprint for my ACAT 2021 proceedings contribution, [Optimising hadronic collider simulations using amplitude neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04506v1), appeared on arXiv today ([InspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2030214)).
This follows [my recent talk]({{< ref "acat" >}}).
It is also available through the GitLab CI system [here](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/acat2021-proc/proc.pdf) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/acat2021-proc/)).
