Today the preprint of our article [Virtual QCD corrections to gluon-initiated diphoton plus jet production at hadron colliders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08664) appeared on arXiv, in which we compute the two-loop gluon fusion to diphoton plus jet amplitude, providing it ready for phenomenological application in an [accompanying NJet release.]({{< ref "njet3" >}})
