I was on the committee for the [YTF 2019](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/825/timetable/?view=standard) and [YTF 2020](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/937/timetable/?view=standard) conferences.
For YTF20, I also gave a non-specialist talk on precision QCD.
The talk is [recorded](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/937/contributions/5039/attachments/4088/4823/RyanMoodieYTF20.mp4) and the slides are available [here](https://eidoom.gitlab.io/ytf20) ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/ytf20)) ([discussion of tech](https://computing-blog.netlify.app/post/reveal/)).
