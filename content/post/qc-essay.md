The module PH3014 Transferrable Skills for Physicists is a unique highlight of the St Andrews Physics Undergraduate programme.
I had Paul Cruickshank as advisor for the module and enjoyed it greatly, developing my skills in oral and written communication and team work.
In particular, I made good progress with my fear of public speaking.

The module includes a literature review project in which we produce a report on a topic and give a presentation on it at the wonderful Burn conference.
Supervised by Chris Hooley, I studied quantum computers and wrote [this article](../../docs/qc-essay.pdf).
[These](../../docs/burn-talk.pdf) are the slides for my talk.
