To improve my teaching in higher education, I'm doing a course at Durham called Gateway to Academic Practice.
It leads to the Durham Excellence in Learning and Teaching Award Level 1 and Associate Fellowship of [Advance HE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/).
It is aligned to Descriptor 1 of the [UK Professional Standards Framework](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/guidance/teaching-and-learning/ukpsf) (which explains the following `[AKV]\d`).
Here's my account of professional practice ([source](https://gitlab.com/eidoom/delta1-essay)), which I'll submit for assessment.

## A2: Teaching and the Support of Learning

This year I am a workshop demonstrator in level four Particle Theory for MPhys Theoretical Physics. At this highest level of the undergraduate degree, I hold that it is imperative to allow students the greatest possible autonomy while balancing against the support required to broach such an advanced topic. The class is prescribed in the form of the students working though a problem sheet which we provide to them; beyond this, I foster an environment of active learning (Bonwell and Eison 1991). Such student-centred learning is shown to be favourable in subjects like physics (Freeman et al. 2014) and in my personal experience is highly engaging and effective. [K3,V3]

My interaction with the students is mostly discursive. In the early minutes of the class, I give the initiative to the students to ask questions, inviting them to control their own learning. In answering, I act as a facilitator of learning rather than a presenter of knowledge: nudging in the right direction rather than telling the answer, often by rephrasing the problem in a more accessible way [V1]. As the session progresses, I pose questions to the class in regular intervals and in answer to those of individuals. I first assess students’ understanding and bolster their confidence with lower-order questions, which also focus attention on salient points. I am careful to allow a generous wait time for responses (Rowe 1972) then prompt with closed questions if discussion stalls. With knowledge established and momentum built, I let the students direct subsequent progression, guiding with higher-order questions if necessary. Throughout, my questions are informed by my knowledge of the course’s content and assessment and, with the module sharing its specialisation with my research, my practitioner’s comprehension of the field [K1]. I always respond positively to answers, even if they are wrong (Becker 2017), which I find encourages further interaction. This is an intense learning state to engage in for an hour; the students respond well to a brief respite in the middle while I touch on the points of the next paragraph. The SOLO taxonomy (Biggs 1982) categorises students’ level of engagement with course material, which I use to inform these teaching methods. Students generally enter each class with a multistructural understanding of the relevant lecture content. This structure aims to help students progress to the extended abstract level. [K2,K3,V3]

Providing motivation to students is a critical role of the teacher. The teaching activities I described above serve to motivate through passing choice and control to the students as well as building belief in their own ability and self-efficacy (Bartimote-Aufflick et al. 2016). Furthermore, I try to inspire students’ interest by sharing my passion towards the field and giving insight into the context of what they are learning within cutting-edge research [K1]. I also indicate the relevance of the problems by showing how they fit into the module and their degree as a whole, as well as the applicability of the skills involved to future employment [V4]. This covers key factors identified in literature for student motivation (Pintrich 2003). [V3]

## A4: Developing Effective Learning Environments and Learner Support

Due to coronavirus restrictions, my teaching this year is entirely online. This presents a radically different learning environment for the module than what both I and students are used to. The module lecturers and I work together to continuously evolve our delivery of the course as we adapt to the novel situation.

In my experience as a theoretical physics workshop demonstrator over the past few years, I have noticed some students will somewhat blindly jump into the mathematics of the problem sheet and end up floundering if they are not lucky. I find starting the session with a holistic exposition of the worksheet helps the students to link the problems with lecture content and bridge over from previous workshops, and provides clear learning aims to guide them forward (Ashmore 2014) [V3]. In particular, this nurtures their independent research skills by hinting where to start reading when they get stuck [V4]. This helps achieve a fertile and mature educational context to their learning environment. [K2,K3]

The most significant change I have made to the virtual setting since starting is to introduce breakout rooms. This emulates the function of group tables in a physical setting. We split the class in two randomly and I take one group while the current lecturer takes the other. Feedback from the students (see A5) reveals that they feel far less peer anxiety in the smaller setting so are much happier to ask questions. This agrees with my observation of dramatically increased student engagement [K5]. I also take advantage of anonymous polling technology to ask closed questions with inclusive participation [K2]. This is very helpful to gauge class progress. Using a tablet with screenshare is vital to communicating mathematics. [K4,V1]

As an educator, I take steps to present myself online in an approachable manner. This is particularly important in the online environment as it can feel isolating for both students (Haythornthwaite et al. 2000) and teachers [V3]. I keep my camera on at all times and keep my attention on the class to visually confirm my presence to the students. I find that I am more comfortable and engaged in teaching while standing up so run the workshops from a standing desk. I am careful to speak clearly and at a slower pace to ensure everyone can hear me regardless of audio equipment quality. [K2]

Also to counter the digital disconnect, I make extra effort to cultivate a sense of belonging within the class. Even during normal teaching, I have found that it is common for students in this field to experience a degree of imposter syndrome (Parkman 2016), so I view the feeling of community as essential (Rovai and Jordan 2004) [V3]. During the lessons, I maintain respectful and friendly relationships with the students, learning their names and starting conversations; this works well with the small class size of a dozen [K2,V1]. Outside the classroom, I keep an open door in answering email questions. I have also led informal sessions about my research and postgraduate life within the department’s virtual social space as well as encouraging students to attend an early career researcher conference hosted at Durham and a national women in physics conference. [V2,V4]

## A5: Engage in continuing professional development in subjects/disciplines and their pedagogy, incorporating research, scholarship and the evaluation of professional practices

My practice is mostly influenced by apprenticeship of observation (Lortie 2020). I have been fortunate in receiving a variety of teaching from three institutions—recognising both good and bad. For example, as an undergraduate I was inspired by the unconventionally active and conceptual methods employed in my electrodynamics course and the related study I participated in (Baily et al. 2015). While it has its utility, I find over-reliance on passive learning detrimental to engagement and long-term retention. [K1,K2,K3]

To help adapt to virtual teaching, I attended meetings run by my department where I engaged in open discussions about how best to use the technology. My peers and I also self-organised trial sessions to explore the online platforms before term started. We have maintained regular “corridor discussions” to reflect on our teaching experiences together. For example, this inspired the switch to breakout rooms. [K4,K5]

As I mentioned in A4, I work closely with the lecturers of the module to iteratively improve how we present the module. Early in the year, I ran sessions together with the first lecturer in the same virtual room. While I later found breakout rooms to be superior, this provided a valuable opportunity for us to mutually peer observe [K5]. Through this, I gained further insight into the module’s content and how to present these specific topics in a legible manner [K1]. We also held short retrospectives after lessons where we shared feedback on observation and identified students’ weak points to be reinforced next time [K5].

In addition to informal conversations with students, which are useful for continuing feedback but may be an environment in which they are not comfortable sharing everything [V1], I distributed an anonymous online questionnaire [K4,K5]. I did this once the format of the workshop had stabilised, which was towards the end of the course, so its main utility will be in informing my teaching next year. The students were highly perceptive in picking up on the discussed efforts I have made to improve their experience, and praised them. Some comments indicated the level of guidance was high while others suggested it was too low; even arguments in either direction suggest to me that the level of challenge was set about right. One point lacking was the ability to have one-on-one discussions so I will be sure to incorporate this option into future teaching. With all forms of student feedback, I strove to act within the top steps of the Biggs model, adapting my teaching in response—“what the student does”—while not getting in the way of the student developing their own framework—“how the student manages what the student does” (Biggs 2011) [V3]. [K2,K3]

Early in my perusing of the Gateway to Academic Practice course, I discovered the Kolb-Lewin Learning Cycle (Kolb 2014). This provided a productive framework to support my experiential learning in supporting others’ learning. My initial Planning drew on previous teaching experiences and early discussions. I cover my actions in the Doing stage in A2 and A4. Evaluation from myself, peers, and students formed the evidence on which to Reflect. I like the Conceptualise step for its focus on reviewing reflection against literature and colleagues and the new insight this brings. [V3]
